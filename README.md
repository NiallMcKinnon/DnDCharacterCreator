If my understanding is correct, we can add our Java code to /src/main/java/charactercreator/dndcharactercreator/. There might be a way to simplify the file structure but this is what IntelliJ generates for a new JavaFX Project.

## How to clone repository into IntelliJ:

### First time:
1. On GitHub, select Clone -> copy the URL listed under HTTPS.
2. In IntelliJ, select File -> New -> Project from Version Control.
3. Enter the URL and hit Clone.

### Subsequent times:
1. Open the project in IntelliJ.
2. Select Git -> Update Project.
3. Code added by other users will now be cloned to your computer.

## How to push your code to the Repository:
1. Make sure all work is saved.
2. On the left sidebar, select Commit.
3. Check the "changes" option. There should be a list of all the files that you've modified.
4. Enter a note describing your updates in the text box.
5. Hit "Commit and Push" to update the repository.
6. There may be warnings about unused files, ignore them.
